# Wild Drift Champion Classifier

Preprocessing steps:

* Dectect circles in test images. A circle can be described using three parameters - row index, column index, and radius. The row and column indices represent the location of the circle's center.

* Select the left most circle in the detected list (the circle that has the smallest column index).
* Crop the image precisely to the diameter of the selected circle's edge.
* Resize the cropped images to 42 x 42 pixels to match the ground truth's size.

Compare test images to groundtruths:

* Distances: Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
* For each test image, iterate through the ground truth set and calculate SSIM and PSNR.
* The ouput of a test image is the label of the reference image that has the highest score (SSIM/PSNR) when compared to the test image.

Accuracy:

* SSIM Measure: 52.041%
* PSNR Measure: 40.816%
